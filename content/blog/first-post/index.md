### Hello, and Welcome!

This is my very first blog post. This entire website was set up and built using R and the R package blogdown. Upfront, I want to give a huge thank you to the community of R users that made this website possible! In particular, I want to thank the authors of the blogdown package and the blog tutorials given by Alison Hill. You can find her tutorials on [her website](https://www.apreshill.com). It is truly amazing how much you can do with R, and I am so grateful for the knowledge and tools passed down in the open-source community. 

With that out of the way, I want to use this first blog post to introduce myself a bit better. My name is Brenden Smith and I am currently in graduate school pursuing a Master’s degree in Public Health at Michigan State University. I got into PH after studying U.S. health policy during my time in undergrad. I have also had the pleasure of working as a research assistant at the MSU Institute for Health Policy for the past year. If you’re interested in the work we do there, you can visit our website [here](https://ihp.msu.edu). 

### Why Public Health?

The most interesting part of public health is how broad it can be. A huge part of the field is dedicated to understanding how factors of our built environment impact our behaviors, quality of life, and health outcomes. Historically, medical innovations have received most of the praise when it comes to the improvement in quality of life standards and decrease in mortality rates. However, much of the decline in mortality can be attributed to improvements in clean water, housing, and public safety. 

In recent years, the conversation has shifted into the exploration of social determinants of health — the social, economic, and societal factors that influence our health and well-being. This side of public health particularly interests me, especially as it concerns issues of health equity. 

I have a strong interest in the way we use data within public health. Being an evidence-based field, this is often at the forefront of public health interventions and evaluations. Unfortunately, the field as a whole has gone underfunded. But I believe there is a lot of opportunity in using existing tools to improve this area of PH. As a public health professional, I want to be prepared to clean, manipulate, analyze, visualize, and interpret data to inform public health practice and research. 

### So What is This?

I want to end this post by giving a better description of what you’ll find on this blog. This is a public-facing, professional website. I wish for this project to be a frank display of my use and implementation of data analysis techniques, but also a place for organizing my thoughts and displaying other projects I’m involved in. I may post more traditional “blog posts,” data projects, book reviews, or other writings from my coursework. I hope you will follow along and reach out if you want to network or get to know each other. I am trying to be more active on my Twitter, Instagram, and Github. If you feel like connecting, please do not hesitate to reach out! That’s all for now — stay tuned for more updates.
